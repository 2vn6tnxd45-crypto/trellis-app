                At HausKey ("we," "our," or "us"), we respect your privacy and are committed to protecting the personal information you share with us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our property management application (the "Service").
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">1. Information We Collect</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">We collect information that you provide directly to us when you use HausKey:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-4 text-gray-600">
                <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you register, we collect your email address and password. If you use third-party login services (Google, Apple), we collect the identifiers provided by those services.</li>
                <li><strong>Property Data:</strong> We collect the property addresses, system details (HVAC, plumbing, etc.), maintenance records, and photos you upload to your Home Log.</li>
                <li><strong>Contractor Submissions:</strong> If you use our Contractor Request feature, we collect the data submitted by third parties via the links you generate.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">2. How We Use Your Information</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">We use the collected information for the following purposes:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-4 text-gray-600">
                <li>To provide, operate, and maintain the HausKey Service.</li>
                <li>To allow you to access, manage, and update your property records.</li>
                <li>To generate reports (such as the Property Pedigree) at your request.</li>
                <li>To communicate with you about updates, security alerts, and support messages.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">3. Data Ownership & Transfer</h3>
            <p class="mb-4 text-gray-600">
                <strong>Your Data is Yours.</strong> HausKey claims no ownership over the specific property records you create. The primary value of our Service is to create a transferable digital record. You may choose to transfer your account and all associated property data to a new owner upon the sale of your home.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">4. Disclosure of Your Information</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">We do not sell your personal information. We may share information only in the following situations:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-4 text-gray-600">
                <li><strong>With Your Consent:</strong> We may share information if you explicitly authorize us to do so (e.g., sending a Pedigree Report to a buyer).</li>
                <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We may share data with third-party vendors (like Google Cloud or Firebase) who perform services on our behalf, such as hosting and database management.</li>
                <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">5. Security of Your Information</h3>
            <p class="mb-4 text-gray-600">
                We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information. This includes encryption of data in transit and at rest via our cloud providers. However, no electronic transmission or storage system is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">6. Children's Privacy</h3>
            <p class="mb-4 text-gray-600">
                Our Service is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">7. Changes to This Policy</h3>
            <p class="mb-4 text-gray-600">
                We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.
